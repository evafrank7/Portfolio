        <h4 class="about-subtitle"> Hello, my name is Eva.</h4>
        <p> I am a recent 2024 graduate from Bucknell University with a degree in Computer Science. While at Bucknell, I competed on the university’s Division I varsity women’s soccer team! Before Bucknell, I studied Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, my hometown school. While studying at Pitt and playing for the school’s soccer team, I made the decision to transfer to Bucknell in order to make a greater impact. </p>
        <p> I am currently working as a Data Analyst at Kenvue, where I’ve rediscovered my passion for web design and development. I’m now seeking a career in web development to continue pursuing this passion and grow as a developer. Having taken several web design and development classes in college, I’m now diving deeper by completing additional courses through Codecademy and Coursera. </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoyed exploring my portfolio! Please feel free to reach out if you’d like a copy of my resume. </p>
